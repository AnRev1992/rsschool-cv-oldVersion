                <h2>About myself</h2>
                <p> 
                I'm 29 years old. At that moment I work as a team leader in an oil company (Belarusneft). The main task of my work is to reduce well construction time and cost. 
                At school I was actively involved in programming, participated in Olympiads and conferences at the district and regional levels. After leaving school, it was not possible to enter the FITR BNTU, therefore, I followed in the footsteps of my brother and studied at the Faculty of Mining Ingenering. I graduated from the university with the third best ball on my course, was the chairman of the student council of the faculty. 
                As a result, I became an oil ingener, achieved a worthy position for my age, but faced the limit of development at a state-owned enterprise. 
                Now I decide to change the direction of my activity and do what I liked from my childhood.
                Now I am actively involved in programming, English and front-end development.
                I have no practical experience in applying my knowledge on a commercial project yet, but I am sure that I can quickly join the development process and be useful to the employer.
